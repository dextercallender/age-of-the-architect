> Deep history is a reunion of deep time with historiography into a “seamless narrative that acknowledges the full chronology of the human past.” \(Daniel Lord Smail, [On Deep History and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-History-Brain-Daniel-Smail/dp/0520258126), 2007 \)

> Self-styled Indiana Joneses, “Megalithomaniacs,” psychonauts, seekers, seers, and skeptics of academic orthodoxy, alt-archaeologists troll the hubris of orthodox historiography with models that account for out of place artifacts like the Nazca lines and underwater civilizations, the Antikythera machine and the Baghdad battery, overgrown pyramids, impossible megaliths, and the elongated skulls of ancient giants. While their
conclusions are controversial, their archive contains a critical mass of potent architectural evidence far off the radar of polite architecture discourse. There is gold to be mined down the rabbit hole of conspiracy
history. \(me, "Social Soup", Ed, is.1, forthcoming\)
