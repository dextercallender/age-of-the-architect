# Week 2

#Objective
* What does VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) mean for architecture?
* Is computing as a universal metaphor a threat to architecture?
* What is Rao's Impasse and how does Keller attempt to bypass it?

# Method: Speculative Discursive Field
This week we will begin to build out our "speculative discursive field" by collectively creating:
* glossary of concepts
* mind map of the idea spaces of different authors
* bibliography of related texts
* list of valuable quotes
* object list of case studies
