# Week 2: Prometheanism, Normalization, Disposition

![Ribbonfarm Greater Cultural Region, 2016](/assets/RibbonfarmMap2016.jpg)

> Increased anxiety is only one dimension of how we experience change. Another dimension is a constant sense of crisis (which has, incidentally, always prevailed in history)... A third dimension is a constant feeling of chaos held at bay (another constant in history), just beyond the firewall of everyday routine (the Field is everyday routine). \(Venkatesh Rao, ["Welcome to the Future Nauseous"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/05/09/welcome-to-the-future-nauseous/)\)

## Objective
* To swallow the Venkat Rao red pill and understand why architectural thinking is fraught in the 21st century
* To unpack Keller Easterling's cybernetic epistemology and understand her implicit response to Subcritical Disease

## Questions
* What does VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) mean for architecture?
* Is computing as a universal metaphor a threat to architecture?
* What is Subcritical Disease and how does Keller attempt to bypass it?

## Method: Speculative Discursive Field
This week we will begin to build out our "speculative discursive field" by collectively creating:
* glossary of concepts
* mind map of the idea spaces of different authors
* bibliography of related texts
* list of valuable quotes
* object list of case studies
