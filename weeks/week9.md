Week 9: Consciousness Effects, Hyperstition and the Breakaway Civilization

> For any initiatory ritual to ‘work,’ be it a Heb Sed or the installation of a new tribal chieftain or shaman, it must necessarily be experienced as consciousness effects. \(Gordon White, *Star.Ships: A Prehistory of the Spirits*, 2016, p.258\)

> The interest in Lovecraft’s fiction was motivated by its exemplification of the practice of hyperstition, a concept had been elaborated and keenly debated since the inception of the Cthulhu Club. Loosely defined, the coinage refers to ‘fictions that make themselves real’. \(Ccru. [Ccru: Writings 1997-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0)\)

> If you have the opportunity to stand next to one of these machines it is an awe-inspiring thing... it feels like an altar to an alien god. \(Geordie Rose, ["Quantum Computing and Three Dangerous Predictions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyUbWl8jPQU), 2013\)
