Week 9: Consciousness Effects, Hyperstition and the Breakaway Civilization

> For any initiatory ritual to ‘work,’ be it a Heb Sed or the installation of a new tribal chieftain or shaman, it must necessarily be experienced as consciousness effects. \(Gordon White, *Star.Ships: A Prehistory of the Spirits*, 2016, p.258\)

> The interest in Lovecraft’s fiction was motivated by its exemplification of the practice of hyperstition, a concept had been elaborated and keenly debated since the inception of the Cthulhu Club. Loosely defined, the coinage refers to ‘fictions that make themselves real’. \(Ccru. [Ccru: Writings 1997-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0)\)

> If you have the opportunity to stand next to one of these machines it is an awe-inspiring thing... it feels like an altar to an alien god. \(Geordie Rose, ["Quantum Computing and Three Dangerous Predictions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyUbWl8jPQU), 2013\)

> It is necessary to ask, rather, who do capitalists pay for political favors, how much these favors are potentially worth, and how the authority to grant them is distributed. This requires, with a minimum of moral irritation, that the entire social landscape of political bribery (‘lobbying’) is exactly mapped, and the administrative, legislative, judicial, media, and academic privileges accessed by such bribes are converted into fungible shares. Insofar as voters are worth bribing, there is no need to entirely exclude them from this calculation, although their portion of sovereignty will be estimated with appropriate derision. The conclusion of this exercise is the mapping of a ruling entity that is the truly dominant instance of the democratic polity. Moldbug calls it the Cathedral. \(Nick Land, [The Dark Enlightenment](http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/)\)

> Properly used, magic will destroy your life. This is a feature, not a bug. \(Gordon White, [The Chaos Protocols: Magical Techniques for Navigating the New Economic Reality](https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Protocols-Techniques-Navigating-Economic/dp/0738744719), 2016\)
