# Week 8: Social Soup

*Note: as this is midterm week, the readings/watchings will be light, and class time will be more of a prepared lecture than a discussion. I will try to summarize what we have encountered so far and illustrate where we are going.*


## Readings
* Gordon White, Star.Ships, chapter 7
* Ramsey Dukes, S.S.O.T.B.M.E. Revised: An Essay on Magic, 
* Venkatesh Rao, "The Scientific Sensibility"
