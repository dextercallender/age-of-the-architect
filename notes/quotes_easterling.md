# Keller Easterling Quotes

## Disposition

Keller seems to have a pancomputationalist perspective: "Information resides in the technologies... as well as in the declared intent or story." 71 Active form is a way of seeing this information in the shape of disposition.

Disposition is a way to think about infrastructure without just focusing on the objects it moves through space, but the infrastructure and its configuration itself.

"hacking into it requires forms that are also like software." 72

"Active forms are markers of disposition, and disposition is the character of and organization that results from the circulation of these active forms within it." 73

"hack the suburban software" 74

"Many active forms circulating in the software that makes up infrastructure space can be used to hack that software. Well not offering comprehensive control over an organization, active forms can nevertheless be inserted to counterbalance or redirect a disposition." 80

"When the object of design is not an object form or a master plan but I set of instructions for an interplay between variables, design requires some of the power in currency of software. This special software is not a thing but a means to craft a multitude of interdependent relationships and sequences-an updating platform for inflecting a stream of objects." 80

"As the levers of disposition in infrastructure space, active forms, in different languages and into place, or tools of extrastatecraft." 81

"When summoned to create an active form, designers naturally really rely on what they are best train to create-a formal object representing action or dynamic process." 81

"Disposition remains as a latent potential or tendency that is present even in the absence of an event... to assess disposition is to assess how an organization deals with the variables overtime-how it absorbs or deflects the active forms moving within it. Disposition does not describe a constant but rather a changing set of actions from which one might assess agency, potentiality, or capacity." 83

"Ryle refutes those theories that associate disposition with 'occult' agencies or regard things like the unshattered glass as temporal processes that are in 'a sort of limbo world.'" 83

"Active form may partner with and propel object form determining how it will align with power to travel through infrastructure space." 84

"There is no desire for a singular, comprehensive or utopian solution. Power lies rather in the prospect of shaping a series of activities in relationships over time." 85

"Like Ryle, Bateson did not regard this activity to be 'supernatural' or occult, but rather saw information as an ordinary currency for exchanges between humans and non-humans." 85

"Temperament or political bearing— The tension, violence, stability, or resilience imminent in organizations." 86

"It may seem far-fetched to assign temperament to infrastructure spaces, the concentrations of power, tension, competition, and submission are immanent to their arrangements." 88

"The misalignment between the activity of an organization and its stated intent is often the first signal signal of an undeclared disposition." 88

"An active form can also be a social story–not a vessel in which to fix meaning but a carrier to channel a flow of meanings. Form, Latour writes, is 'simply something which allows something else to be transported from one site to another... To provide a piece of information is the action of putting something into a form.' A story as an active form, however immaterial and non-spatial, can inflect disposition in infrastructure space and can be deployed with spatial intent." 90

"The action, not to be confused with movement or choreography, is the real carrier of information, meaning, and change, and it may be entirely disconnected from the text. Comfort with crafting discrepant, indeterminate action allows design to engage both the naturally occurring dislocations of meaning as well as the duplicitous politics of extrastatecraft." 91-92

"Disposition is an extra diagnostic tool for assessing undisclosed capacity or political bearing in infrastructure space. A multitude of active forms can be used to both detect and adjust a disposition. Like powerful bits of code that can hack the infrastructural operating system, these forms may be technologica, organizational, or social." 92

"For Foucault a *dispositif* was 'a thoroughly hetereogeneous ensemble consisting of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and philanthropic positions–in short, the said as much as the unsaid.'" 92

"The designer of disposition in infrastructure space is a performer." 92

"Not limited to prescription, the designer can engage in improvisation–in the pleasures of *knowing how* as well as *knowing that*." 93

"Ideological stories have the power to buckle concrete and bend steel, and they can often be difficult to escape." 93
