# Week 2 Notes

#Objective
* What does VUCA mean for architecture?
* Is computing as a universal metaphor a threat to architecture?
* What is Rao Disease and how does Keller attempt to bypass it?

## Rao Disease
* how can architecture incorporate a tinkering methodology?

## Weaknesses of Rao Disease
* Misses the ability of Scifi to capture realism of our present/future

# Method: Speculative Discursive Field
This week we will begin to build out our "speculative discursive field" by collectively creating:
* glossary of concepts
* mind map of the idea spaces of different authors
* bibliography of related texts
* list of valuable quotes
* object list of case studies
