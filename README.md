Why do the contemporary deities of tech pray to the pagan gods of Burning Man? Why does Elon Musk believe we are living inside of a simulation? Why does Peter Thiel hold a New Zealand passport? Why did Alex Jones think the Sandy Hook mass murder was a hoax? Why did 1/5 of Americans think Obama was the anti-Christ? What does any of this have to do with architecture? To begin to formulate an answer to these questions we need to go back to the beginning.

Origin stories are the magical commodity of architecture theory: they grant legitimacy while skirting falsifiability. They command worldviews without offering proof. They are the perpetual motion machines of authority. Vitruvius understood this. So did Banham. Laugier is remembered for little more than his.
After two millennia of speculation, origin stories have fallen out of favor in architecture theory just as accelerationist conspiracy theorists, Evangelical pastors, alt-right meme magicians, and political technologists have employed them at scale to shift global order. But reactionaries do not have a monopoly on deep time; science has also begun to lay a new claim on pre-history. Recent discoveries in evolutionary psychology, archaeology, paleoanthropology, paleontology, paleoclimatology, anthropogeny, primatology, deep history, theology, indigenous studies, cave art, and the history and effects of psychedelics have shed light on what was long thought to be unknowable.

Some recent discoveries are too hot for history; their implications too radical for the disposition of academia. Challenging the very foundations of our social orders, they are above the pay grade of our professional storytellers. Addressing their implications requires braving the rabbit holes of the conspiracy theorists, seers, skeptics, self-styled Indiana Jonseses, and other “alt-archaeologists” and the out of place dots they attempt to connect.

In this seminar we will investigate the various discoveries and theories of the contemporary discourses of pre-history — credentialed and crackpot alike — to theorize their consequences for the figure of the architect. HINT: it may have very little to do with design; it will not be tethered to buildings.
The seminar will begin with a crash course in the esoteric knowledge required to jump into the more speculative reports, such as the occult, Hermeticism, Gnosticism, magic, ritual, ancient Egyptian spiritualism, shamanism, and other marginal histories, theologies, and practices. These will be complimented with selected readings from architecture theory, tech entrepreneurialism, military and business strategy, and other supporting discourses. We will then move into weekly research assignments and presentations.

#### Midterm Deliverable
Each student will deliver a 12 minute presentation on a single “architect” selected from a prepared list. Examples may include Thomas Jefferson, Christopher Wren, Hiram Abiff, Imhotep, Vitruvius, Phidias, Daedalus, Steve Bannon, and Vladislav Surkov.

#### Final Deliverable
Presentation and booklet that expands the midterm research to one of the topics of the Guggenheim exhibition. Topics will be introduced in class.

#### Running Collective Deliverable
The seminar will start with a definition of the architect that each student will fork (i.e. copy) and regularly update based on class discussions, annotating changes with their rationale.

#### Paranoid Critical Method 
One of the principal lessons of the seminar is that recent discoveries of our pre-history should serve as a reminder of how little we know of our ancient history. As such, we will not be attempting definitive accounts, nor will we be genuflecting to the canonical accounts of others. Rather, we will first scour discourse indiscriminately, sifting through heterogeneous sources as if panning for gold: solid evidence valuable beyond the context of its discovery. We will ultimately hold it up to the light of critique, but not until we have indulged our own paranoia. This is an attempt to operationalize the method Koolhaas scripted from Dalí.
