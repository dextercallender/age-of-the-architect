# Age of the Architect
*Graduate seminar at Columbia University (Fall 2017)*

### Syllabus (v.0.3)
*Note: I am using Github because this syllabus will be updated regularly. Changes will be reflected in the [commit logs](https://github.com/troyth/age-of-the-architect/commits/master).*

Why do the contemporary deities of tech pray to the pagan gods of Burning Man? Why does Elon Musk believe we are living inside of a simulation? Why does Peter Thiel hold a New Zealand passport? Why did Alex Jones think the Sandy Hook mass murder was a hoax? Why did 1/5 of Americans think Obama was the anti-Christ? What does any of this have to do with architecture? To begin to formulate an answer to these questions we need to go back to the beginning.

Origin stories are the magical commodity of architecture theory: they grant legitimacy while skirting falsifiability. They command worldviews without offering proof. They are the perpetual motion machines of authority. Vitruvius understood this. So did Banham. Laugier is remembered for little more than his.
After two millennia of speculation, origin stories have fallen out of favor in architecture theory just as accelerationist conspiracy theorists, Evangelical pastors, alt-right meme magicians, and political technologists have employed them at scale to shift global order. But reactionaries do not have a monopoly on deep time; science has also begun to lay a new claim on pre-history. Recent discoveries in evolutionary psychology, archaeology, paleoanthropology, paleontology, paleoclimatology, anthropogeny, primatology, deep history, theology, indigenous studies, cave art, and the history and effects of psychedelics have shed light on what was long thought to be unknowable.

Some recent discoveries are too hot for history; their implications too radical for the disposition of academia. Challenging the very foundations of our social orders, they are above the pay grade of our professional storytellers. Addressing their implications requires braving the rabbit holes of the conspiracy theorists, seers, skeptics, self-styled Indiana Jonseses, and other “alt-archaeologists” and the out of place dots they attempt to connect.

In this seminar we will investigate the various discoveries and theories of the contemporary discourses of pre-history — credentialed and crackpot alike — to theorize their consequences for the figure of the architect. HINT: it may have very little to do with design; it will not be tethered to buildings.
The seminar will begin with a crash course in the esoteric knowledge required to jump into the more speculative reports, such as the occult, Hermeticism, Gnosticism, magic, ritual, ancient Egyptian spiritualism, shamanism, and other marginal histories, theologies, and practices. These will be complimented with selected readings from architecture theory, tech entrepreneurialism, military and business strategy, and other supporting discourses. We will then move into weekly research assignments and presentations.

#### Midterm Deliverable
Each student will deliver a 12 minute presentation on a single “architect” selected from a prepared list. Examples may include Thomas Jefferson, Christopher Wren, Hiram Abiff, Imhotep, Vitruvius, Phidias, Daedalus, Steve Bannon, and Vladislav Surkov.

#### Final Deliverable
Presentation and booklet that expands the midterm research to one of the topics of the Guggenheim exhibition. Topics will be introduced in class.

#### Running Collective Deliverable
The seminar will start with a definition of the architect that each student will fork (i.e. copy) and regularly update based on class discussions, annotating changes with their rationale.

#### Paranoid Critical Method 
One of the principal lessons of the seminar is that recent discoveries of our pre-history should serve as a reminder of how little we know of our ancient history. As such, we will not be attempting definitive accounts, nor will we be genuflecting to the canonical accounts of others. Rather, we will first scour discourse indiscriminately, sifting through heterogeneous sources as if panning for gold: solid evidence valuable beyond the context of its discovery. We will ultimately hold it up to the light of critique, but not until we have indulged our own paranoia. This is an attempt to operationalize the method Koolhaas scripted from Dalí.

### Schedule
#### Week 1: Junktime

> If ‘Junkspace is what remains after modernization has run its course,’ then Junktime is the mess digitization has made of temporality. \(me, “Junkspace”, [After Belonging: Objects, Spaces, and Territories of the Ways We Stay in Transit](https://www.amazon.com/After-Belonging-Objects-Territories-Transit/dp/3037785209), 2016\)

#### Week 2: Refactored Perception

> Experiments in refactored perceptions is a geek joke. It refers to changing how you see the world by trying to rewire the software inside your head through writing. \(Venkatesh Rao, [Ribbonfarm.com/about](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/about/)\)

#### Week 3: Tempo

> Tempo: The set of characteristic rhythms of decision-making in the subjective life of an individual or organization, colored by associated patterns of emotion and energy. \(Venkatesh Rao, [Tempo glossary](http://www.tempobook.com/glossary/#tempo)\)

#### Week 4: Deep History

> Deep history is a reunion of deep time with historiography into a “seamless narrative that acknowledges the full chronology of the human past.” \(Daniel Lord Smail, [On Deep History and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-History-Brain-Daniel-Smail/dp/0520258126), 2007 \)

#### Week 5: Alt-History

> Self-styled Indiana Joneses, “Megalithomaniacs,” psychonauts, seekers, seers, and skeptics of academic orthodoxy, alt-archaeologists troll the hubris of orthodox historiography with models that account for out of place artifacts like the Nazca lines and underwater civilizations, the Antikythera machine and the Baghdad battery, overgrown pyramids, impossible megaliths, and the elongated skulls of ancient giants. While their
conclusions are controversial, their archive contains a critical mass of potent architectural evidence far off the radar of polite architecture discourse. There is gold to be mined down the rabbit hole of conspiracy
history. \(me, "Social Soup", Ed, is.1, forthcoming\)

#### Week 6: Stoned Apes

> Even as the nineteenth century had to come to grips with the notion of human descent from apes, we must now come to terms with the fact that those apes were stoned apes. (Terrence McKenna)

#### Week 7: Chaos Magic

> Properly used, magic will destroy your life. This is a feature, not a bug. \(Gordon White, [The Chaos Protocols: Magical Techniques for Navigating the New Economic Reality](https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Protocols-Techniques-Navigating-Economic/dp/0738744719), 2016\)

#### Week 8: Cathedrals

> It is necessary to ask, rather, who do capitalists pay for political favors, how much these favors are potentially worth, and how the authority to grant them is distributed. This requires, with a minimum of moral irritation, that the entire social landscape of political bribery (‘lobbying’) is exactly mapped, and the administrative, legislative, judicial, media, and academic privileges accessed by such bribes are converted into fungible shares. Insofar as voters are worth bribing, there is no need to entirely exclude them from this calculation, although their portion of sovereignty will be estimated with appropriate derision. The conclusion of this exercise is the mapping of a ruling entity that is the truly dominant instance of the democratic polity. Moldbug calls it the Cathedral. \(Nick Land, [The Dark Enlightenment](http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/)\)

#### Week 9: Hyperstition

> The interest in Lovecraft’s fiction was motivated by its exemplification of the practice of hyperstition, a concept had been elaborated and keenly debated since the inception of the Cthulhu Club. Loosely defined, the coinage refers to ‘fictions that make themselves real’. \(Ccru. [Ccru: Writings 1997-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0)\)
