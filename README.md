Why do the contemporary deities of tech pray to the pagan gods of Burning Man? Why does Elon Musk believe we are living inside of a simulation? Why does Peter Thiel hold a New Zealand passport? Why did Alex Jones think the Sandy Hook mass murder was a hoax? Why did 1/5 of Americans think Obama was the anti-Christ? What does any of this have to do with architecture? To begin to formulate an answer to these questions we need to go back to the beginning.

Origin stories are the magical commodity of architecture theory: they grant legitimacy while skirting falsifiability. They command worldviews without offering proof. They are the perpetual motion machines of authority. Vitruvius understood this. So did Banham. Laugier is remembered for little more than his.

After two millennia of speculation, origin stories have fallen out of favor in architecture theory just as accelerationist conspiracy theorists, Evangelical pastors, alt-right meme magicians, and political technologists have employed them at scale to shift global order. But reactionaries do not have a monopoly on deep time; science has also begun to lay a new claim on pre-history. Recent discoveries in evolutionary psychology, archaeology, paleoanthropology, paleontology, paleoclimatology, anthropogeny, primatology, deep history, theology, indigenous studies, cave art, and the history and effects of psychedelics have shed light on what was long thought to be unknowable.

Some such discoveries are too hot for history; their implications too radical for the disposition of academia. Challenging the very foundations of our social orders, they are above the pay grade of our professional storytellers. Addressing their implications requires braving the fringe rabbit holes of conspiracy theorists, chaos magicians, seers, skeptics, self-styled Indiana Jonseses and other 'alt-archaeologists'. In this seminar we will investigate the various discoveries and theories of the contemporary discourses of pre-history — credentialed and crackpot alike — to project their consequences for the archetype of the architect.

We will begin with a wake up call from tech theorist Venkatesh Rao. Put simply, he sites the Promethean fire of Silicon Valley squarely in its anti-architectural metaphysics: "Big Men" like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos determine the "critical path" of History precisely because they subvert the zero sum thinking of an architectural worldview. 

with Mark Wigley's thesis, culled from Derrida--that the authority of Western philosophy is grounded in the figure of architecture--in order to go beyond it. 

New insights and evidence, often controversial, allow us to paint a convincing picture of pre-rational architecture. Our objective will be to recontextualize the origins of architecture by considering new perspectives on the historical potency of psychedelics, shamanism, star lore, and magic. These will be our time machines back to the 

architectural pre-history with new, sometimes controversial, discoveries in the origins of Western philosophy,

Following Mark Wigley's attempt to situate architecture prior to Platonic philosophy, 

We will use Mark Wigley's thesis, borrowed from Derrida, 


Magic will be our time machine

Doing so will require questioning the dominant cosmology of scientific materialism. Doing so effectively will require a direct engagement with different forms of knowledge than the epistemological and discursive.

HINT: it may have very little to do with design; it will not be tethered to buildings.

The seminar will begin with a crash course in the esoteric knowledge required to jump into the more speculative reports, such as the occult, Hermeticism, Gnosticism, magic, ritual, ancient Egyptian spiritualism, shamanism, and other marginal histories, theologies, and practices. These will be complimented with selected readings from architecture theory, tech entrepreneurialism, military and business strategy, and other supporting discourses. We will then move into weekly research assignments and presentations.


### Deliverables
*Note: there will be two options for deliverables that we will decide as a group in week 3.*

#### Option 1: Cryptocurrency ICO
We will launch our own EC-20 compliant cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Each student will contribute to various aspects of the project, including: developing the concept, writing the whitepaper, writing the smart contract for the ICO, branding and graphics, building the website, and community management and hype.

#### Option 2: Recontextualizing 'Architect' and 'Architecture'
We will collectively define both 'architect' and 'architecture' by applying the insights from our weekly readings and discussions to a running group definition of each, and running personal definitions. This will include presentations that profile architects that belong to what Michael Witzel calls "grandmother stories"–Hiram Abiff, Imhotep, Vitruvius, Phidias, Daedalus–and recontextualizations of the discipline's "grandfather stories" by considering occult interpretations omitted from the canon–Thomas Jefferson, Christopher Wren, as well as architects more publicly engaging the esoteric, such as Bernard Maybeck and Christopher Alexander. Each student will ultimately produce a presentation and research book\(let\) that corresponds to one of the topics of the Guggenheim exhibition.


### Methodology

#### Paranoid Critical Method (h/t Rem Koolhaas)
One of the principal lessons of the seminar is that recent discoveries of our pre-history should serve as a reminder of how little we know of our ancient history. As such, we will not be attempting definitive accounts, nor will we be genuflecting to the canonical accounts of others. Rather, we will first scour discourse indiscriminately, sifting through heterogeneous sources as if panning for gold: solid evidence valuable beyond the context of its discovery. We will ultimately hold it up to the light of critique, but not until we have indulged our own paranoia. This is an attempt to operationalize the method Koolhaas scripted from Dalí.

#### Recontextualization (h/t Gordon White)
> The western esoteric tradition has the opportunity to (finally) do away with the High Victorian assumptions that constitute our understanding of the origins of magical culture and rebuild atop some much better data. The picture that emerges in doing so is stunning in its implications. This is not history. This is not archaeology. This is not folklore. This is a new skill. But it is also an old one. It is not the skill of organising data points into a sequential historical narrative. It is the skill of context. Of recontextualising the Western magical tradition as it has arrived in our hands here in the twenty first century, rather than seeking to replace it wholesale with each new development, as if it were last year’s smartphone. The magicians of the Renaissance or the Natural Philosophers of Charles II’s Britain gathered observations and findings from the cutting edge research of their day to build a coherent view of their Art and their world. Just as they were, we must be polyhistors. \(Gordon White, Star.Ships: A Prehistory of the Spirits, 2016\)

#### Active Form (h/t Keller Easterling)
> Disposition is the character or propensity of an organization that results from all its activity. It is the medium, not the message. It is not the pattern printed on the fabric but the way fabric floats. It is not the shape of the game piece but the way the game piece plays. It is not the text but the constantly updating software that manages the text. Not the object form, but the active form... Detecting and developing the active forms that shape disposition is an essential skill of the urbanist in infrastructure space. \(Keller Easterling, [Extrastatecraft: The Power of Infrastructure Space](https://www.amazon.com/Extrastatecraft-Power-Infrastructure-Keller-Easterling/dp/1784783641), 2014\)

#### Speculative Discursive Field
Foucault codified the concept of a discursive field to map the history of ideas and meaning as they mutated through different epistemological regimes. We will use a vulgar version of his method by applying it loosely to the mapping of an emerging idea space. Our objective will be to articulate connections and coincidences across ideas generated by authors of starkly different world views and domains of expertise to speculate on the contours of a new field of thinking. 


### Schedule
#### Week 1: Recontextualization

> If ‘Junkspace is what remains after modernization has run its course,’ then Junktime is the mess digitization has made of temporality. \(me, “Junkspace”, [After Belonging: Objects, Spaces, and Territories of the Ways We Stay in Transit](https://www.amazon.com/After-Belonging-Objects-Territories-Transit/dp/3037785209), 2016\)

#### Week 2: Prometheanism, Normalization, Disposition

> Experiments in refactored perceptions is a geek joke. It refers to changing how you see the world by trying to rewire the software inside your head through writing. \(Venkatesh Rao, [Ribbonfarm.com/about](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/about/)\)

#### Week 3: Counterculture, Cyberculture, Cryptoculture

> A blockchain is a magic computer that anyone can upload programs to and leave the programs to self-execute, where the current and all previous states of every program are always publicly visible, and which carries a very strong cryptoeconomically secured guarantee that programs running on the chain will continue to execute in exactly the way that the blockchain protocol specifies. \(Vitalik Buterin, [Ethereum Blog, April 13, 2015](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/13/visions-part-1-the-value-of-blockchain-technology/)\)

#### Week 4: Deep History

> Deep history is a reunion of deep time with historiography into a “seamless narrative that acknowledges the full chronology of the human past.” \(Daniel Lord Smail, [On Deep History and the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-History-Brain-Daniel-Smail/dp/0520258126), 2007 \)

#### Week 5: Alt-History

> Self-styled Indiana Joneses, “Megalithomaniacs,” psychonauts, seekers, seers, and skeptics of academic orthodoxy, alt-archaeologists troll the hubris of orthodox historiography with models that account for out of place artifacts like the Nazca lines and underwater civilizations, the Antikythera machine and the Baghdad battery, overgrown pyramids, impossible megaliths, and the elongated skulls of ancient giants. While their
conclusions are controversial, their archive contains a critical mass of potent architectural evidence far off the radar of polite architecture discourse. There is gold to be mined down the rabbit hole of conspiracy
history. \(me, "Social Soup", Ed, is.1, forthcoming\)

#### Week 6: Stoned Apes

> Even as the nineteenth century had to come to grips with the notion of human descent from apes, we must now come to terms with the fact that those apes were stoned apes. (Terrence McKenna)

#### Week 7: Chaos Magic

> Properly used, magic will destroy your life. This is a feature, not a bug. \(Gordon White, [The Chaos Protocols: Magical Techniques for Navigating the New Economic Reality](https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Protocols-Techniques-Navigating-Economic/dp/0738744719), 2016\)

#### Week 9: Cathedrals

> It is necessary to ask, rather, who do capitalists pay for political favors, how much these favors are potentially worth, and how the authority to grant them is distributed. This requires, with a minimum of moral irritation, that the entire social landscape of political bribery (‘lobbying’) is exactly mapped, and the administrative, legislative, judicial, media, and academic privileges accessed by such bribes are converted into fungible shares. Insofar as voters are worth bribing, there is no need to entirely exclude them from this calculation, although their portion of sovereignty will be estimated with appropriate derision. The conclusion of this exercise is the mapping of a ruling entity that is the truly dominant instance of the democratic polity. Moldbug calls it the Cathedral. \(Nick Land, [The Dark Enlightenment](http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/)\)

#### Week 10: Hyperstition

> The interest in Lovecraft’s fiction was motivated by its exemplification of the practice of hyperstition, a concept had been elaborated and keenly debated since the inception of the Cthulhu Club. Loosely defined, the coinage refers to ‘fictions that make themselves real’. \(Ccru. [Ccru: Writings 1997-2003](https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0)\)
